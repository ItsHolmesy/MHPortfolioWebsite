My Portfolio Website

Hi there, this is kind of my little web-develeopment and hub for all my portfolio work - even if github achieves the same thing, I love the idea of a user-friendly and easy to navigate, interactable way to reach and review all my works.
The bulk of the website's HTML and CSS was done over a year ago when I reworked an old community website I was making into a personal portfolio, though recently I added the dice game, opting to take a class and object-oriented approach to creating it.
I used AI (Chat GPT) to help diagnose issues and debug, however I programmed solutions manually based on the identified problems.

Issues/To-Dos

- Make Dice Game more readable with clearer user feedback based on rolls and losses.
-     In saying that, also make the win condition functional.
- Add one-page weather app.
